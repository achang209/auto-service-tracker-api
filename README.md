# Project Stack:
Java 13, Gradle 6.0.1, Spring (Spring Boot, Spring Data), Hibernate, and MySQL.

## Overview:
A RESTful web service that is consumed by my [Auto Service Tracker client application](https://github.com/achang209/auto-service-tracker-client/blob/master/README.md). 
This application pairing allows users to keep track of their car's maintenance history. This project was inspired after numerous
visits to disparate car shops and not being able to recall when or who last serviced a particular part of my car.

## Current Features:
Users can save and edit their invoice details, search their invoices by various properties (i.e. vendor or repair),
and upload/download a PDF of their original invoice.

## Next Steps:
I would like to implement some sort of authentication/authorization mechanism (probably Spring Security) to allow my application to be used by multiple users. Also, I would like to deploy my application.
